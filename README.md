## Coin Viewer

Coin Viewer is a simple Cryptocurrency data app.

## APIs
CoinGecko provides prices
CryptoCompare provides news

## Plans
I have plans to implement features as I progress in Dart and Flutter

- Allow users to keep track of crypto purchases
- Auto update the coin values (price, percentage change, rank)
- A news tab that utilizes an API (maybe CryptoCompare.com) - DONE
- Specific coin information (Graphs, historical data)
- More
