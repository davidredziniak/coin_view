# Coin Viewer

Coin Viewer is a simple Cryptocurrency viewing app utilizing the free CoinGecko API.

This is a cool little first flutter app I started to make.

## Plans

I have plans to implement many features as I learn more about Dart and Flutter.

Some include:

- Auto update the Coin values (price, percentage change, rank)
- A news tab that auto updates utilizing an API (maybe CryptoCompare.com)
- Specific Coin information
- More
